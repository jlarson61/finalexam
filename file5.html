Aerys II Targaryen was known as "the Mad King". His reign started wonderfully, with twenty years of peace and prosperity. However,
many accredited the success to his Hand, Lord Tywin Lannister. Coupled with numerous stillbirths, a kidnapping, and the growing support
of his own son Prince Rhaegar, would be the sparks that started Robert's Rebellion, and all but ended the Targaryen family.
