Aegon I Targaryen conquered six of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Only Dorne was able to resist. Aegon I was harsh with those who defied him,
he was generous with those who paid him their respects. He was willing to let others run Westeros, but never shied from taking control when he thought it necessary.
